      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a piece on linkedin from an entrepreneur who is encouraging his employees to use AI to put themselves out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory an employee who follows that advice will then have the ability to move on to more interesting jobs and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if his intentions were good, I&amp;rsquo;m sure what many of his staff were actually hearing was &amp;ldquo;you should train your replacement before we fire you&amp;rdquo;. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;I read a piece on linkedin from an entrepreneur who is encouraging his employees to use AI to put themselves out of a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory an employee who follows that advice will then have the ability to move on to more interesting jobs and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if his intentions were good, I&amp;rsquo;m sure what many of his staff were actually hearing was &amp;ldquo;you should train your replacement before we fire you&amp;rdquo;. &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as a leader, this sentiment is 100% true. As you&amp;rsquo;re growing your business, you need to slowly let loose of jobs so that you can focus on more important things a business needs. You need to automate, improve and delegate. And for any highly motivated individual this is probably good advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we applied this idea to AI itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if the best AI would be the one that instead stealing our agency, helped us become stronger, more collaborative and self-sufficient?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
