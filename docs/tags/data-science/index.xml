If you want an editor that works with R, python, SAS, Stata, SQL and
almost any other data science language. If you want an editor with
IDE-like features. If you want an editor that works on any platform and
as well as on the terminal. If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of literate
programming. If you want an editor that is highly customizable and
will be around after most editors have come and gone, then you&amp;rsquo;d be
hard pressed to find anything better than emacs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr:
If you want an editor that works with R, python, SAS, Stata, SQL and
almost any other data science language. If you want an editor with
IDE-like features. If you want an editor that works on any platform and
as well as on the terminal. If you&amp;rsquo;re a fan of literate
programming. If you want an editor that is highly customizable and
will be around after most editors have come and gone, then you&amp;rsquo;d be
hard pressed to find anything better than emacs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work in exclusively in R, you might want to work in&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;Rstudio&lt;/a&gt; . If
you work in python, you might be tempted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/&#34;&gt;Spyder&lt;/a&gt;. Chances are there
is a specialized IDE for whatever language you typically work in. But
that&amp;rsquo;s the rub. What if you want to work in another language? Or
combine languages? You end up using several IDEs, but not knowing them
well. Plus, once they fall out of favor or stop being updated, your
hard-gained knowledge is lost. At the other end of the spectrum there
are text editors like notepad++ and sublime. These work with just
about any language you can imagine and with some add-ons you can get
additional features, but they tend to be limited to certain platforms
and customization is often non-trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modern data scientist often has to work on multiple platforms with
multiple languages. Some projects may be in R others in Python. Or
perhaps you have to work on a cluster with no gui. Or maybe you need to
write papers with latex. You can do all that with Emacs and customize
it to do whatever you like. I won&amp;rsquo;t lie though. The learning curve can
be steep, but I think the investment is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some key features that I think make Emacs an excellent
editor for any data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ide-like-features&#34;&gt;IDE-like features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most programming languages, you get out-of-the-box syntax
highlighting. Packages like &lt;a href=&#34;http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html&#34;&gt;ESS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy&#34;&gt;Elpy&lt;/a&gt; provide additional features
like autocompletion, documentation and debugging capabilities. The
number of IDE features available will vary by language, but at minimum
there is probably syntax highlighting and some form of autocompletion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_autocomplete.png&#34;  alt=&#34;autocomplete in emacs&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;autocomplete in emacs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I enjoy is easy access to help and function
parameters &amp;hellip; which often also come with autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/blog_R_help_syntax.png&#34;  alt=&#34;help for functions&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;help for functions&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;



  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_parameter_help.png&#34;  alt=&#34;parameter help for functions&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;parameter help for functions&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Enough with the print statements already and debug that R and python code!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_debug.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Interactive debugging with conditional breakpoint&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Interactive debugging with conditional breakpoint&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the features that first sold me on Emacs was interactive
commands. With a keyboard short cut you can send a buffer, function,
paragraph or line to the interpreter. Let me be clear &amp;ndash; you don&amp;rsquo;t
even have to highlight the code. This saves you a ton of time when you&amp;rsquo;re
doing statistical analysis[fn:: Like many other features this will
depend on the package you install. That said, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to
implement this feature for your favorite language].&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_interactive.gif&#34;  alt=&#34;interactive&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Interactive Commands&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;sql-too&#34;&gt;SQL too&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you work with databases? Many of the same benefits mentioned above
also apply to sql. Work with sqlite, postgresql, mysql and other databases
interactively. Do you have a long SQL statement you are debugging? No
problem. Iterate quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_sqlite.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Interactive SQL&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Interactive SQL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;org-mode--literate-programming&#34;&gt;Org mode / Literate Programming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you write publications? Do you want to keep your code and paper
together? You a believer in reproducible research? With emacs you can
put any language you want in your document. While Rstudio allows this
also, you&amp;rsquo;re limited to just R and latex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_literate.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Literate Programming&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Literate Programming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;do you need latex? No problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\frac{3}{4}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They key to this magic is a monster package called &lt;a href=&#34;http://orgmode.org/features.html&#34;&gt;org mode&lt;/a&gt;. It is one of
emac&amp;rsquo;s killer features. You can also use this to organize your code
&amp;hellip; or your life.&lt;/p&gt;
$$\frac{3}{4}$$&lt;h1 id=&#34;terminalremote-editing&#34;&gt;Terminal/remote editing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime you need to remote into a server. Or perhaps you are working on a
cluster with no gui and you need to interactively debug your scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_terminal.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Emacs works in the terminal&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Emacs works in the terminal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;interacting-with-the-shell&#34;&gt;Interacting with the shell&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there are terminal command you wish you could run? In emacs you can
run terminal commands easily. But what makes this feature super cool
is that it can operate on your text. You can select a region of code,
send it to a terminal command and have that stdout replace the text in
your buffer!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_shell.png&#34;  alt=&#34;Using SED to find and replace text&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Use terminal commands to operate on text&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;rectangle-editing&#34;&gt;Rectangle editing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data scientists often work with tabular data. Sometimes you may want
to delete or move a column around. Or perhaps there is a block of
white space you need to change.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;figure class=&#34;center&#34; &gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.robertvesco.com/img/emacs_rectangle.gif&#34;  alt=&#34;Using rectangle mode to alter blocks of text&#34;   style=&#34;max-width:100%; width:auto; margin:0px 0px 0px 0px;border-radius: 15px; -moz-border-radius:15;&#34;  /&gt;
    
      &lt;figcaption class=&#34;left&#34;  style=&#34;color: black;&#34; &gt;Using rectangle mode to alter blocks of text&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
  &lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;h1 id=&#34;everything-at-your-finger-tips&#34;&gt;Everything at your finger tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs has numerous packages that allow you to search and find files,
functions and anything else that you can imagine. But by far the best
is helm. With just a few keys you can instantly find what you are
looking for. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it justice, but this demo gives you a taste
for the amazing things it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html&#34;&gt;http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any feature you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re wedded to sublime&amp;rsquo;s multiple cursors? You can get it:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://emacsrocks.com/&#34;&gt;http://emacsrocks.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps you&amp;rsquo;re a long time vim user? Evil Mode
gives you the editing power of Vim with the utility of emacs. If you&amp;rsquo;re
a git user, Emac&amp;rsquo;s has magit which make working with git a joy. If there
is something that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have, check for pacakges, else emacs is the most customizable
editor you will find. Almost everything about it can be made to work
your particular work flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;30-years-old-and-a-large-user-base&#34;&gt;30+ years old and a large user base&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs has been around a long time. Code that was written a decade ago
mostly still work. And every year it&amp;rsquo;s getting better. However, emacs
24 is amazing. If you tried emacs years ago, you should give it
another try. It now has package management built in, so you can easily
add testing packages. Importantly, there is no sign that emacs is
going away anytime soon and it&amp;rsquo;s free. It will likely be around for at
least another decade if not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;so-what-are-the-downsides&#34;&gt;So what are the downsides?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;legacy-code-on-the-intertubes-confuses-people&#34;&gt;Legacy code on the intertubes confuses people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs has been around a long time. Emacs 24 was a huge improvement,
but it also broke a lot of things. Same goes for Org-mode between
versions 7 and 8. A lot of stuff on the intertubes will lead you
astray and frustrated if you&amp;rsquo;re not aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emacs-lisp-for-customization&#34;&gt;Emacs-lisp for customization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually enjoy working with lisp because it is so different from
other languages I work with. However, many others would prefer using a
language like python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-noob-friendly&#34;&gt;Not noob friendly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs is not like the cheerful, always smiling bro with the
abercrombie face. First encounters can be painful and awkward. It&amp;rsquo;s
not sublime. That said, there are several starter packages to enable
useful features out-of-the-box. For scientists, Kieran Healy&amp;rsquo;s starter
package might be useful:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit/&#34;&gt;http://kieranhealy.org/resources/emacs-starter-kit/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another useful package is prelude: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude&#34;&gt;https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on a Mac, I&amp;rsquo;ve heard aquamacs will keep you warm and comfy:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://aquamacs.org/&#34;&gt;http://aquamacs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these will give you the power of emacs, quickly. Personally, I
prefer to build my emacs up by scratch so it does what I want it to do
and no more. But these packages are great ways to get a feel for it&amp;rsquo;s
power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-packages&#34;&gt;Multiple packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you decide you want to work with python be prepared to experiment
with lots of different python packages. While emacs has basic python
support, you probably want linting, refactoring or other useful
features. Many packages have tried to implement these features, some
better than others. Personally, I like Elpy, but it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect. The
downside of options is that you have to wade through them. It can be
painful sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-am-i-missing&#34;&gt;What am I missing?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I tried to include most of the features that I think would
appeal to data scientists, let me know if I missed any killer
feature and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to include it here.
