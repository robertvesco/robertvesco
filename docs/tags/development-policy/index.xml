      <description>&lt;p&gt;Teece&amp;rsquo;s 1986 piece on profiting from innovation makes the following
claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend in international business towards what Miles and
Snow call &amp;ldquo;dynamic networks&amp;rdquo; – characterized by vertical
disintegration and contracting – ought thus be viewed with
concern. (Business Week, March 3, 1986, has referred to the same
phenomenon as the Hollow Corporation.) &amp;ldquo;Dynamic networks&amp;rdquo; may not
so much reflect innovative organizational forms, but the
disassembly of the modern corporation because of deterioration in
national capacities, manufacturing in particular, which are
complementary to technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Teece&amp;rsquo;s 1986 piece on profiting from innovation makes the following
claim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend in international business towards what Miles and
Snow call &amp;ldquo;dynamic networks&amp;rdquo; – characterized by vertical
disintegration and contracting – ought thus be viewed with
concern. (Business Week, March 3, 1986, has referred to the same
phenomenon as the Hollow Corporation.) &amp;ldquo;Dynamic networks&amp;rdquo; may not
so much reflect innovative organizational forms, but the
disassembly of the modern corporation because of deterioration in
national capacities, manufacturing in particular, which are
complementary to technological innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamic networks may therefore signal not so much the rejuvenation
of American enterprise, but its piecemeal demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 20 years later, Andy Grove, co-founder and former Intel CEO, makes the following claim in a piece about how to bring jobs back to America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I believe the answer has to do with a general undervaluing of
manufacturing—the idea that as long as &amp;ldquo;knowledge work&amp;rdquo; stays in
the U.S., it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what happens to factory jobs. It&amp;rsquo;s not
just newspaper commentators who spread this idea. Consider this
passage by Princeton University economist Alan S. Blinder: “The TV
manufacturing industry really started here, and at one point
employed many workers. But as TV sets became &amp;lsquo;just a commodity,&amp;rsquo;
their production moved offshore to locations with much lower
wages. And nowadays the number of television sets manufactured in
the U.S. is zero. A failure? No, a success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree. Not only did we lose an untold number of jobs, we
broke the chain of experience that is so important in
technological evolution. As happened with batteries, abandoning
today’s &amp;ldquo;commodity&amp;rdquo; manufacturing can lock you out of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s
emerging industry.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
