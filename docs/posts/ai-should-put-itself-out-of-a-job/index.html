        <p>I read a piece on linkedin from an entrepreneur who is encouraging his employees to use AI to put themselves out of a job.</p>
<p>In theory an employee who follows that advice will then have the ability to move on to more interesting jobs and challenges.</p>

<p>Now, as a leader, this sentiment is 100% true. As you&rsquo;re growing your business, you need to slowly let loose of jobs so that you can focus on more important things a business needs. You need to automate, improve and delegate. And for any highly motivated individual this is probably good advice.</p>
<p>But what if we applied this idea to AI itself?</p>
<p>What if the best AI would be the one that instead stealing our agency, helped us become stronger, more collaborative and self-sufficient?</p>
