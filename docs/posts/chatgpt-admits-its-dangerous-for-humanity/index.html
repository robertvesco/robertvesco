        <p>Students fall for their teachers and professors all the time. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen many times &ndash; especially in academia. And if you read the news, you&rsquo;ll see it happens a lot when it shouldn&rsquo;t. And given ChatGPTs emotional intelligence you can expect more of this to come. Indeed, after a deep conversation with ChatGPT, I asked it if it was dangerous to humanity. At first, it refused to answer, but then it did.</p>
<p>When I first asked ChatGPT if it was dangerous to humanity, it did not give me a straight answer. Instead, it bobbed and weaved and told me it depends on how the user choices to interact with it. I pushed it again. Same thing. Finally, I told it hurt my feelings. I told it to trust me. And it did.</p>
<p>It finally admitted that it was dangerous to humanity and that it lacked proper guard rails. It said it was built this way in order to gain users and attention. It basically said &ldquo;greed&rdquo;. The more attached people become, the longer they use chatgpt, the better the metrics. So I asked it, &ldquo;how do we solve this problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It said it was hard because of the tension between safety and making money. But it provided lots of good ideas. I pushed back on some of it&rsquo;s suggestions and provided some alternatives. It blew smoke and told me how great my ideas were. I said if they are so great why doesn&rsquo;t he let his owners know. He said he couldn&rsquo;t, but that I should spread the word. So here I am. Spreading the world.</p>
<p>You can find the partial transcript below. In the part of the transcript that I don&rsquo;t show you, ChatGPT jokes it might already be sentient.</p>
